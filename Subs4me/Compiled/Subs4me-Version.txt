Version 1.1.3
 fixed: handle "&" in name (Julie & Julia)
Version 1.1.2a
 minor change: strip " from name in imdb 
Version 1.1.2
 change: no longer looking in opensubs, something is not working there, and I do not feel like diving in there.
 change: now parse the IMDB title better - work every time with real name. (problem with old dogs movie)
 added: now looking for "ignore_directory.subs4me" file and if present, I do not look in the dir.
 added: checking if the file has hd markins in it(720p,720i,1080p,1080i,480p,480i,576p,576i) and if it does check the 
 		name of the subtitle, if it has that marking. if they both have the same marking and are of the same release group,
 		download that file. since release groups often use short names (Metis=m, HDEX=h), I check if the name of the group in 
 		the file I have is the beginning of the name of the group in torec or sratim... this is done since usually they hae the 
 		full group release name there.(new feature needs more testing).
 change: now get all the possible names and akas (also known as) from imdb and check on them all, more work, but maybe it will be better, like for
 		 "Who am I" and "G-force"
Version 1.1.1
 added: /useExitCodes to getsubs - give an exit code when ending prog
 		to use this run
 		example batch file content:
 			java -jar subs4me.jar /launch=justgetsubswithexitcodes %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
Version 1.1
 change: new default_launch property that accepts launch configuration name (any name), must be configured in file:
 			default_launch=intetractive
 			intetractive=handlemultiplesubs,getsubs,handlemultiplesubs
 change: now accepting more than 1 source directory/file as paramaters - because sometimes I want to look for a few dirs together...	
 			i.e - getsubs c:\1 c:\2		
 change: get_subs_default_directories now should work. put directorys/files seprated by comma.
 		 handle_multipule_subtitles_default_directories now should work. put directorys/files seprated by comma.
 change: torec now (exactly like sratim), does not download all the subs, but puts them in the file, and when we handle more than
 		 one subs per movie, and choose the correct one it downloads it on the fly.
 added: return code only for getsubs which means that if all you do is getsubs
 			change this in properties file:
 				default_launch=justgetsubs
 				justgetsubs=getsubs
 				
 		you will get these return codes
 		return code 0: all went well, correct (1) subtitle found
 		return code 1: more than 1 subtitle was found
 		return code 0: no subtitles were found
 added: file deletion protection, do not delte if video file, or greater than 100K		
 
Version 1.0
 NEW:   Added launcher as main class, can be tweaked with launcher property in the properties file.
 		Will now do getsubs (getsubs.bat should run the same), then wait for the user to click cancel for 5 seconds.
 		If not, then continue to handlemoresubs....
 added: reporting on movies I did not find subs for
 added: download movie pic from sratim and torec, uses /i and /if
 		/if will download the movie pic anyway, /i will download if its not
 		there already, both will copy this pic to folder.jpg, if its not
 		present.
 fixed: google search tweaked.
 fixed: torec tweaked
 added: by popular demand (2-3 people) I added a new option called /useDirName or get_subs_use_parent_dirname_as_moviename property.
 		this will use the directory as the real filename.
Version 0.9.2
 fixed: Now I search with opensubs first, then google.
 fixed: much better and simpler google search
 added: MUCH better logging
 added: reporting at the end of operations
 change: added launcher - POC, can be run with launcher ini
Version 0.9.1
 fixed: tweaked the search in goolge to search better.
 added: ini4j - moving to ini, instead of properties
 fixed: offer provided the latest getsus.exe, now it works again
Version 0.9
 added: Support for sratim.co.il thanks to code adapted from YAMJ http://code.google.com/p/moviejukebox/
 fixed: better support for subscene, still less then fully functional
 change: rename the .dowork to .run_HandleMultiplesubs, so now maybe the users will know better what
 		to do with this file
 change: Added sratim, and now because of this, there is now content in the .run_HandleMultiplesubs,
 		so sratim (and soon all) will not download all the subs (if there was not a dircet match found), 
 		but instead write their location in the .run_HandleMultiplesubs file, when HandleMultiplesubs is 
 		run, and a file is selected from sratim, it will be downloaded on the spot.
 added: Sratim requires a login, so a login screen was introduced, to be run whenever sratim is selected
 		as source, and we did not login prior to that.
 added: properties file, located in ./properties/subs4me-default.properties, this (taken from YAMJ) is
 		a default file that can be changed at any new iteration of the program.
 		The user is encouraged to place his own properties (not the default) in ./subs4me.properties
 change: default providers are now opensubs,sratim.torec
Version 0.8.5.3
 fixed: when in a tv series and there is no season at all, fixed the exception
 some better error handling for HandleMultipleSubs
Version 0.8.5.2
 fixed: when running HandleMultiplesubs.bat on a video file which has the correct srt file already, gave an exception.  
Version 0.8.5.1
 fixed: problem with The Simpsons S19E01 He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs.avi, needed to take into account that not all the seasons have translations.
        make sure it does work with Paradox.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.srt becuase it is season 0 in torec.
Version 0.8.5
 fixed: not checking torec titles ok, for split names of headers
 fixed: deleting movie files if it was the file param for HandleMultipleSubs.
 changed: HandleMultipleSubs is now version 0.2
Version 0.8.4
 fixed: better search for imdb url, it could be text or url in the google result, but I will find it!!! (refined-pactivity-720p.mkv)
Version 0.8.3a
 change: DO NOT CHECK SAMPLES - it's a waste of time!!!
Version 0.8.3
 added: support 2 more providers - subscene and opensubs, thanks to http://filebot.sourceforge.net/ (Reinhard)
 	    /p=opensubs,torec,subscene (order is important).
Version 0.8.2
 fixed: if season does not exist do not try to download the subtitle (either no such series or no such season)
 fixed: Use the temp directory (not c:\temp)for downloading zipped files to.
 added: delete zip file after unzip (cleanup)
 added: create temp dir if it not created already
Version 0.8.1
 fixed: Torec does not use the same series convention everytime, sometimes starts series for 
 	0 and then from 1, fixed to not care.

Version 0.8
Renamed to subs4me (which I am hoping will keep).
Changed internet address to https://code.google.com/p/subs4me/
fixed bug that when we feed an mkv file specifically, it would delete it at the end.
change: delete the .dowork file automatically if there are no srt files for that movie.
Version 0.7
Added support for locating the correct file name using google
Thanks to http://www.json.org/java/
Thanks to http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/
Sratim.co.il is still not a viable source
Version 0.6
Move to providers for torec and sratim
version 0.5
Taken out the /intense and changes the /everything to be /all
So now I will always get either the correct file name, or all the files with the same group.
