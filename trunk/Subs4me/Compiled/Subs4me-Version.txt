Version 0.7
Added support for locating the correct file name using google
Thanks to http://www.json.org/java/
Thanks to http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/
Sratim.co.il is still not a viable source
Version 0.6
Move to providers for torec and sratim
version 0.5
Taken out the /intense and changes the /everything to be /all
So now I will always get either the correct file name, or all the files with the same group.
